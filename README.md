# Sarah's Neighborhood Map
Udacity FEND Nanodegree Project 7

## About My Project

This is my neighborhood map! I used Zurb Foundation to create the responsive layout and knockout.js for the interactive components. My additional API is Flickr photos.

## Installation

To build this project, download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarahla/udacity-p7-neighborhood-map.git
```
If you don't have node installed on your computer, [get it here](http://nodejs.org) and install it

If you don't have gulp installed, run the following command in your command line

```bash
npm install --global gulp
```

Then cd into the project folder, and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Then, run `gulp sass` to run the Sass compiler.

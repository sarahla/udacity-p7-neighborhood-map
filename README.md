# Sarah's Neighborhood Map
_ Udacity FEND Nanodegree Project 7 _

## About My Project

This is my neighborhood map! I used Zurb Foundation to create the responsive layout and knockout.js for the interactive components. My additional API is Flickr photos.

## Installation

To build this project, download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarahla/udacity-p7-neighborhood-map.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Then, run `gulp sass` to run the Sass compiler. 

Finally, open index.html in your browser to run the app!
